## 3. Components
The Crypto Chart is built using various React components. You can find these components in the client/src/components directory. Here are some of the key components:
* `CoinsTable.jsx`: Renders a list of cryptocurrencies with their prices and market data.
* `CoinPage.jsx`: Displays detailed information about a selected cryptocurrency, including historical price charts.

## 5. Known Errors and Expected Issues

While we strive to provide a smooth experience with the Crypto Chart app, there are some known errors and expected issues you should be aware of:

###  API Rate Limits
Issue: External API CoinGecko may have rate limits that could affect data fetching.

Solution: Wait 5 minutes until CoinGecko API gets unblocked and is available again or check the rate limits of the APIs you are using and consider implementing rate-limiting logic in your app to avoid hitting those limits.

### Invalid SearchBar Input
Issue: The app will not proceed to CoinPage and renders blank if a non-existent cryptocurrency coin name is entered.

Solution: Enter a valid cryptocurrency name i.e. bitcoin, tether, cardano, etc.
